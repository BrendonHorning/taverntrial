Question commits for technical trial task.
Q1-4: complete.
local connection to TFS 1.4 and OTClient: complete.
Q5: could not understand how to manipulate the tornado sprites to recreate pattern exactly (they spawn in an X grid unaligned with example?) but otherwise complete.
Q6: currently skipped as allowed due to difficulty.
Q7: incomplete. client-side mod added to add new module for the jump window, loads into OTClient fine, could not figure out how to change styles through Lua to get the button to move.
